Given a novel word and a familiar and a novel referent, children have a bias to assume the novel word refers to the novel referent. This bias -- often referred to as "Mutual Exclusivity" (ME) -- is thought to be a potentially powerful route through which children might learn new word meanings, and,  consequently, has been the focus of a large amount of empirical study and theorizing. Here, we focus on two aspects  of the bias that have received relatively little attention in the literature: Development and experience. A successful theory of ME will need to provide an account for why the strength of the effect changes with the age of the child. We provide a quantitative description of the change in the strength of the bias across development, and investigate the role that linguistic experience plays in this developmental change. We first summarize the current body of empirical findings via a meta-analysis, and then present two experiments that examine the relationship between a child's amount of linguistic experience and the strength of the ME bias. We conclude that the strength of the bias varies dramatically across development and that linguistic experience is likely one causal factor contributing to this change. In the General Discussion,  we describe how existing theories of ME can account for our findings, and highlight the value of computational modeling for future theorizing.

The entire manuscript can be re-rendered from this Rmarkdown file. A rendered version of the paper can be found at `writeup/journal_paper/me_vocab_main.pdf`. The `pre-processing` directory contains all scripts used to pre-process the data before analysis. The `data` directory contains all the  data from the meta-analysis, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.  

The above figure from the paper shows the meta-analytic estimate of the ME bias for different conditions/populations.

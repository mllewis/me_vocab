We also searched from papers using the keyword combination ``mutual exclusivity'' in both PsychInfo and Google Scholar. We identified additional papers that were cited from this initial list. From these, we identified a relevant subset using the following criteria: (a) monolingual child participants, (b) one familiar object present at test, (c) referents were objects (not facts or object parts), (d)  no incongruent cues (e.g. eye gaze at familiar object), and (e) peer-reviewed. We also included a series of studies reported in Frank et al. (2016).\"",
